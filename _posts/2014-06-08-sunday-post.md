We recently added new forums here on XDA for two recently announced and highly anticipated devices. The new devices are the HTC One E8, which is set to be released later this month, and the Sony Xperia T3, which will come at some point in Q3. While we were at it, we also changed a few things to make it easier for developers to post and maintain cross-device variant builds for several Samsung devices.

First up, we have the HTC One E8. The E8 is a lower priced version of the HTC One M8 flagship device. The E8 retains most of the M8 technology, but the metal casing is replaced with a polycarbonate design. Another stand out difference from the M8 is the E8 loses the dual sensor 4 MP camera, and instead features a traditional 13 MP camera. The E8 has the same 5″ 1080p Super LCD3 display, 2 GB of RAM, and Qualcomm Snapdragon 801 2.3GHz processor as its older brother. The device is powered by a reasonable 2600 mAh battery.

Next up is the Sony Xperia T3. The T3 is an upcoming high end device, whose claim to fame is being the world’s slimmest 5.3-inch smartphone–at least for now. This device features a quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 400 processor running at 1.4 GHz, 1 GB of RAM, 8 GB of internal storage, a 13 MP image sensor, and a 720p 5.3″ display. While not flagship material for 2014, the device’s slim 7.0 mm profile will more than make up for this in the eyes of many users.

Finally, you may have noticed some tweaks that we’ve implemented into certain Samsung forums recently. We now offer unified development forums for the Samsung Galaxy S 4, Galaxy S 5, and Galaxy Note 3. Inside, developers will be able to post development work that is compatible with all variants of the aforementioned devices. For example, if you have a build that works with all variants of the S5, you no longer have to create and maintain multiple threads. Instead, you can simply place your thread into the S5 unified development forum and call it a day. With the large number of device variants, this should make it significantly easier for developers to support and maintain their cross-variant builds.
